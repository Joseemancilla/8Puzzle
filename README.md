# 8Puzzle
The 8 puzzle program is a Python tool that solves the 8 puzzle game using the A* algorithm. The 8 puzzle is a game that consists of a 3x3 grid of numbered tiles, with one tile missing. The goal is to rearrange the tiles so that they are in numerical order, with the missing tile at the bottom right of the grid.

To solve the 8 puzzle using the A* algorithm, the program generates a list of all possible configurations of the tiles, including the current configuration. It then uses the A* algorithm to explore the configurations and find a sequence of moves that leads to the solution.

The 8 puzzle program has a number of features that make it easy to use. It allows users to input the initial configuration of the tiles, and it displays the current configuration and the sequence of moves required to reach the solution. The program also includes a visualization feature that shows the movement of the tiles as they are rearranged.
